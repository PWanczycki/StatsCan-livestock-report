||    This program allows the user to compute 3 reports       ||
||    based on Statistics Canada's "Other livestock" census   ||
||    for the years 2011 and 2016.                            ||
||                                                            ||
||    The first report shows a regional percentage            ||
||    breakdown of farms that hosted animals of each type     ||
||    in 2016.                                                ||
||                                                            ||
||    The second report shows the animal type                 ||
||    percentage breakdown for Canada, as well as the         ||
||    percentage change from 2011 to 2016.                    ||
||                                                            ||
||    The third report shows the sub-region within each       ||
||    region that hosted the highest number of horses and     ||
||    ponies in 2016.                                         ||
||                                                            ||
